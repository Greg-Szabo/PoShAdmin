SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PoShAdmin is a versatile and fast SysAdmin toolset for mass management of Windows machines.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PoShAdmin helps System Administrators' life easier by running PowerShell scripts and commands in parallel, on multiple machines, with an easier syntax for commands and with an easy-to-use graphical interface. Combined with the remote functionality of PowerShell this makes daily tasks a breeze. Changing registry keys or services on multiple machines becomes a few clicks.

EXAMPLES
    Use "Import-Module PoShAdmin" to import all functionality.

    Use the command
        [PoShAdmin.Config]::Version
    to find out the PoShAdmin.DLL version that the current session has imported.
